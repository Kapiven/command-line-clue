## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

1. During the morning roll call, The Banker reported odd footprints leading to the playground.
2. You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
3. Go to the council chamber in the town hall.
4. Go back and check the dock in the park.
Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
