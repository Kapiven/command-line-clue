## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

1. During the morning roll call, The Banker reported odd footprints leading to the playground.
2. Check the aisles in the shops. You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
